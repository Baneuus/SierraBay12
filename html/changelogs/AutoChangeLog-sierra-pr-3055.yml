changes:
  - {tweak: Existing "ammo boxes" have been renamed to "magazine boxes".}
  - {tweak: Adding and removing bullets from magazines now has a short timer per bullet.
      Dumping the entire magazine at once onto the ground by using it in your active
      hand is still instant.}
  - {rscadd: You can now transfer bullets between magazines of matching caliburs by
      using magazines on eachother. Have a bunch of partials you want to repack? That's
      a lot easier now.}
  - {rscadd: 'Clicking on a pile of bullets on the ground with a magazine or ammobox
      will now load bullets from the pile into the magazine/box. This intentionally
      does not work when clicking tables or racks, so you can still put empty boxes
      and magazines on those. If your pile is on a table/rack, click on the bullets
      themselves to start the process. For ammoboxes, if the pile has different ammo
      types and the box is empty, click on a specific bulelt to load that specific
      ammotype. Otherwise, it just picks one to load.'}
  - {rscadd: Added proper ammunition boxes - Boxes that contain bullets instead of
      filled magazines. Ammo boxes can only hold a single type of ammunition at a
      time.}
  - {rscadd: 'Added various QOL functions for transferring bullets between bullet
      holders. Clicking magazines, ammoboxes, ammo casings, etc with other mags, boxes,
      etc will transfer rounds between them with short timers per round.'}
